# Classification model for Default prediction
In this data challenge, the problem statement required us to prepare a classification model to predict whether a client will default depending on their characteristics in the data. This will further help a bank in deciding to give the loan or not. It was a project for Data challenge 1 for the STAT 441 (Statistical learning: Classification) at the University of Waterloo.

Here, I used different supervised machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic regression, XGBoost and ensemble of SVM and logistic regression, and  ensemble of logistic regression and decision tree. I prepared data using the feature engineering technique Boruta. 

The model with XGBoost and logistic regression provided the best accuracy, recall value and precision score, hence, these models were selected.
